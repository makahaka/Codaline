				<h2>1  Introduction</h2>
				<p>This short note provides a guide to using the ENTCS macro package for
				preparing papers for publication in your conference <em>Proceedings</em>. The <em>Proceedings</em> may be printed and hard copies distributed to participants at the
				meeting; this is an option to Conference Organizers may choose to exercise.
				The <em>Proceedings</em> also will be par of a volume in the series <em>Electronic Notes
				in Theoretical Computer Science</em> (ENTCS), which is published under the aus-
				pices of Elsevier Science B. V., the publishers of <em>Theoretical Computer Science</em>.

				<p><code>entcsmacro.sty</code>, a macro file containing the definitions of some of the theorem-like environments and a few other tidbits.</p>
				<p>The formatting these style files impose should not be altered { the reason for using them is to attain a uniform format for all papers in the <em>Proceedings</em> of which your paper is a part.</p>
				<p>Additional macro files can be added using \usepackage{...}. The file
				entcsmacro.sty <em>must</em> be included in the list, as is done at the start of the source files for this paper.</p>
				<p>The ENTCS package requires a relatively up-to-date L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X system in order
				to be successfully used. This is re
				ected in two other packages that are called
				by entcs.cls, which must be available on your machine. These are:</p>
				<ul>	
					<li>The <b>hyperref</b> package. This package allows the use of hyperlinks in filesprepared using      L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X2e, one of the main features of Adobe’s Acrobat<sup>&#169;</sup> Reader software. Be sure that you have at least version 6.69d of this pack-age.
					</li>
					<li>The <code>ifpdf</code> package. This is used by hyperref to differentiate between the
		                use of pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X and L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X2e, followed by dvips and then ps2pdf.
		            </li>
		        </ul>
					<p>The file instraut.dvi contains information about the use of L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X to pre-
					pare files for online publication by Elsevier. This file refers to the older version
					of L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X that is no longer suppported, and that is inadequate for preparing
					.pdf files for online publication. Reading this file should answer most of the
					basic questions about L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X that might arise.</p>
			</article>
			<article class="frontmatter_pg1">
				<h2>2 Frontmatter</h2>		
				<p>The biggest difference between a “usual” L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X style such as <code>article.sty</code>
				and the ENTCS package is that the ENTCS macro package requires the title,
				author’s name or names, abstract, keywords and “thanks” all to be included
				within the <code>frontmatter</code> environment. At the beginning of the source file for
				this paper, you’ll notice this. Also, you’ll notice that the usual <code>\maketitle</code>
				is absent; it no longer is needed. The ENTCS style package automatically
				generates the title, author’s name and address, and related material at the
				beginning of the paper. Note also that hyperref has been disabled in this part
				of the entcs.cls file, so references to footnotes aren’t linked to the appropriate
				footenotes or addresses. This is an old problem with L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, involving the fact
				that the references within the frontmatter aren’t passed cleanly to the linking
				oftware.</p>
				<p>For those who have used the ENTCS package before, the one new thing
				to note is the inclusion of <em>Keywords</em>; these are now required by Elsevier –
				they’re also required by ACM’s <em>Computing Reviews</em> which reviews ENTCS
				publications. </p>
				<p>The ENTCS macro package provides two alternatives to listing authors
				names and addresses. These are described in detail in the file <code>instraut.dvi.</code></p>

				<p>Basically, listing each author and his or her address in turn, is the simplest
				method. But, if there are several authors and two or more share the same
				address (but not all authors are at this address), then the method of listing
				authors first, and then the addresses, and of referencing addresses to authors
				should be used.</p>
				<p>Also, notice that acknowledgment of support (the contents of <code>\thanks</code>)
				should be done by a separate listing of <code>\thanks[NSF]{To the NSF}</code> with the
				optional argument – [NSF] – being used for \thanksref which is attached to
				those authors acknowledging such support. It is important that the <code>\thanks</code>
				not be included within the scope of <code>\author{}</code> or of <code>\title{}</code>, but it must
				be within the scope of the environment frontmatter.
				<p>More details about added terms such as <code>\collab</code> can be found in inst.dvi,
				if they are needed.</p>
				<p>Also, notice that the command <code>\lastname{My Lastname}</code> has been in-
				cluded <em>before</em> the frontmatter begins. This command should contain the
				last names of the authors of the paper. If there are more than three au-
				thors, then they should be listed with the word “and” between the last two;
				if more than three  collaborated on the paper, then the first author
				only should be listed, together with <code>\emph{et al}</code>. This command creates
				the headline for each page after page 1.</p>
				<p>Finally, please be sure to include an abstract for your paper.</p>

				<h2>3 Sectioning and Environments</h2>
				<p>Since ENTCS is published through the auspices of Elsevier Science B. V., their
				style files have been used to create the ENTCS macro package. Here’s a proof
				that this package is not much different than most of the ones one encounters:</p>
				<p><strong>Definition 3.1</strong> A file is <em>derived</em> from another if it is obtained with only a few
				modifications from the original file.</p>
				<p><strong>Theorem 3.2</strong> <em>The file</em><code>entcs.cls</code> <em>is derived from</em> <code>elsart.sty.</code></p>
				<p><strong>Proof.</strong> This is clear from the similarity of the output to the output from
				Elsevier’s style files.</p>
				<p>If one wants to start a proof with a descriptive word, such as “sketch”,
				then one can use the <code>\begin{proof*}...\end{proof*}</code> environment, as in
				<p><strong>Proof (Sketch)</strong> This can be derived from simple observations.</p>
				<p>The main differences between the file entcs.cls and the <code>elsartr.cls</code> file
				used by Elsevier are the more precise format we use – Elsevier’s generic files are
				meant for preliminary editing, and more precise formatting is imposed using
				a macro file designed for the specific Elsevier journal in which the paper will
				eventually appear. The entcs.cls and <code>entcsmacro.sty</code> files format papers</p>

		        <p>All of the usual features of L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X are available with these style files – it is only the formatting that has been rigorously defined. Thus, one has
				available the sectioning commands <code>\section,\subsection, \paragraph</code> and
				<code>\subparagraph</code>. The numbering scheme used is one under which Theorem
				1.2.3 is the third numbered item in second subsection of the first section of
				the paper. In order to facilitate cross-references, all of the named environments
				given below are numbered, and all use the same number scheme.</p>
				<p>The file <code>entcsmacro.sty</code> contains additional information that is needed to
				typeset a paper. It also has the definitions of the <code>AMS euler</code> and <code>blackboard</code>
				bold fonts builtin. If you want to use symbols for the natural numbers, the
				reals, etc., then we prefer that you use the blackboard bold fonts, and not
				plain bold fonts. This is accomplished by using the <code>\mathbb</code> font, as in N or R.</p>
				<p>The names of theorem-like environments are provided in <code>entcsmacro.sty</code>.
				With the exception of the environment Algorithm, the names of all of these
				are full name, rather than a shortened version. The environments provided
				and their names are</p>

					<li><code>\begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem} for Theorems,</code></li>

				<h2>4 References and Cross-references</h2>
				<p>All the cross-referencing facilities of L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X are supported, so one can use
				<code>\ref{} and \cite{}</code> for cross-references within the paper and for references
				to bibliographic items. As is done in this note, the <strong>References</strong> section <a href="#" title="#">6</a> can
				be composed with <code>\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}</code>.
				Alternatively, BibT<sub>E</sub>X can be used to compile the bibliography. Whichever
				one is used, the references are to be numbered consecutively, rather than by
				author-defined acronyms. Of course you can use your own acronyms for easy
				reference to each of the items in the bibliography, as has been done with the
				listing for this short note.</p>
				<p>However, note that the references should not be started with a new <code>\section</code> command.</p>
				<p>The package <code>hyperref</code> is automatically loaded by entcs.cls, and this makes
				all the cross-references within the document “active” when the pdf file of the
				paper is viewed with Adobe’s Acrobat&#169; Reader. The format for including
				a link is simple: simply insert <code>\href{URL} {text}</code> where URL is the URL
				to which you want the link to point, and text is the text you want to be
				highlighted, which when clicked upon will bring up the desired web page.</p>
				 <h3><em>4.1 Particulars about</em><code>.pdf</code> files</h3>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;">We now require that .pdf files be provided for publication online. A <code>.pdf</code>
				file is viewable by Adobe’s Acrobat&#169;
				viewer, which can be configured to load
				automatically within a browser. Viewing a properly formatted <code>.pdf</code> file with Acrobat&#169; allows the cross-references and links to URLs to be active. In fact,
				Elsevier utilizes <code>.pdf</code> files in order to take better advantage of the web’s ca-
				pabilities.</p>
				<p>But one point we want to emphasize is that you should be sure to use Type
				1 fonts when you typeset your L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X source file. These fonts are scalable,
				meaning that they carry information that allows the devise viewing the final
				output to scale the fonts to suit the viewer being used – from an onscreen
				viewer such as Adobe’s Acrobat&#169;
				Reader, to printing the file on a printer.
				You can tell if you have used the right fonts by viewing the final output on
				your machine. It the fonts look grainy, then you have not used Type 1 fonts.
				They can be located at the CTAN archive <a href="#" title="http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs"><code>http://www.ctan.org</code></a> – they are
				public domain fonts, and don’t cost anything to add them to your system.</p>
				<p>Assuming you have Type 1 fonts available, then there are there methods
				for producing <code>.pdf</code> files.</p>

				<p><strong>Using</strong> dvips <strong>and</strong> ps2pdf</p>
				<p>We list this option first since it appears to be the most reliable and the
				easiest to use, especially if you include embedded PostScript graphics (<code>.eps</code>
				files) in your source <code>file.</code> Simply run L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X2e on your source file, then apply

			<article class="utility">
				<h3>The <span>DVIPDFM</span> utility</h3>
			<p>Another easy method for producing acceptable <code>.pdf</code> files is via the utility
			dvipdfm. This utility is included in distributions of MikT <sub>E</sub> X, which runs
			on Windows machines, but it probably needs to be added to your teT E X
			distribution, if you are running L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X orf by pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X on a UNIX machine. The utility and
			precise information about installing it on your system can be found at the
			web page <a href="#" title="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/">http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/</a>. In essence, this utility
			converts a .dvi file into a .pdf file. So, one can first prepare the .dvi file
			using L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X orf by pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, and then apply the utility dvipdfm to produce the needed <code>.pdf</code>
			file. <span>4</span> This utility makes inclusion of graphics particularly simple – those that
			are included in the L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X orf by pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X source file are simply converted to the<code>.pdf</code> format.
			As we note below, things are not so simple with the second alternative, which
			is to use pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</p>

				<h3>pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</h3>		  
			<p>An alternative to the first possibilities to produce .pdf files is to process

			This format is available from the standard
			CTAN sites<a href="#" title="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/"> http://www.ctan.org.</a> It appears that pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X and hyperref
			have some problems when used together. It is necessary to use pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X version 14d or later in order to minimize these issues. If your system has
			an earlier version (most teT <sub>E</sub> X distributions have version 13d), then you
			can update your system by retrieving the latest version of pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X from <a href="#" title="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/">ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex/</a>. Even if the

			<p>But there is one aspect of pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X that creates problems. Many authors include EPS <span class="sup"><sup>5</sup></span>
			files within their papers. While this is fairly straightforward
			with L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, there are a couple of points to note when attempting this with pdfL<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</p>
			<p>To include a PostScript image in a .pdf file produced with pdfL

				<h3>Assigning Volume / Issue Numbers</h3>
				<p>One additional point worth mentioning is that ENTCS is moving to Sci-
				enceDirect, Elsevier’s main platform for publishing electronic series, Because
				ScienceDirect must publish entire volumes at the same time, we have changed
				the procedure for preparing final versions so that volume numbers will not
				be assigned until the final versions are ready. Guest Editors will now have
				to receive the final version of all papers in their <em>Proceedings</em> before a volume
				and issue number will be assigned for the <em>Proceedings</em>. Even with the move to
				ScienceDirect, the reference scheme already used for publications in ENTCS –
				<a title="#">http://www.elsevier/nl/locate/entcs/</a> NNnn.html remains the valid way
				to cite papers published in ENTCS, where NN denotes the number of the vol-
				ume, and nn denotes the issue number. Publications consisting of an entire
				volume should use 1 as the issue number.</p>

					<h2>6 Bibliographical references</h2>			
					<p>ENTCS employs the <strong>plain</strong> style of bibliographic references in which references

				  	T<sub>E</sub>X style
					file, for those who wish to use it. It is the file entcs.bst which is included in
					this package. The basic rules we have employed are the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Authors’ names should be listed in alphabetical order, with the first author’s
						last name being the first listing, followed by the author’s initials or first
						name, and with the other authors names listed as <em>first name, last name</em>.</li>
						<li>Titles of articles in journals should be in <em>emphasized</em> type.</li>
						<li>Titles of books, monographs, etc. should be in quotations</li>
						<li>Journal names should be in plain roman type.</li>
						<li>Journal volume numbers should be in boldface type, with the year of pub-
						lication immediately following in roman type, and enclosed in parentheses.</li>
						<li>References to URLs on the net should be “active” and the URL itself should
